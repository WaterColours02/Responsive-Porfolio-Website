# portfolio-Full-Build

Welcome to my portfolio website repository. 

This is a fairly basic responsive website only a few files to navigate. 

If you would like to spin up the files on your own system run "git clone https://github.com/WaterColours02/portfolio-Full-Build.git". 
you will have a clone of the repository. At that point open the "index.html" using an extension such as live serve or copy the relative path to your browser. 

Let me know if you have any suggestions for my next iteration. 

Best regards, 
_Hunter
